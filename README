食譜(shípǔ) is a program that scrapes data of your favorite recipes on cookpad and saves the scraped data in a file.

I am still in the process of its design, but this will be useful because:

    1. You won't have to wait for the recipe to load potentially forever if you are
       experiencing bad internet connection.
    2. You won't have to worry about any ads or trackers following you around.
    3. You won't have to see all other unnecessary information.
    4. You can customize it the way you like.
