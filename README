食譜(shípǔ) is a program that scrapes data of your favorite recipe(s) on cookpad and saves the cleaned data in a file.

I am still in the process of its design, but this will be useful because:

    1. You won't have to wait for the recipe to load potentially forever if you are
       experiencing bad internet connection.
    2. You won't have to worry about any ads or trackers following you around.
    3. You won't have to see all other unnecessary information.
    4. You can customize it the way you like.
    5. You will be able to see those recipes offline.


Todo:

 [ ] Formatting
 [ ] Add commands for Unix and Windows to open the file, but maybe not necessary.
